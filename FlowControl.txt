Flow Control:
-------------
3 types
1.Conditional/selection statements:
-----------------------------------
if
if-else
if-elif-else
identation
if conadition:
   stmts
2.Iterative/Looping  statements:
-----------------------
for
while

for loop:
for eachelement in sequence:
  do some action
ex1:
s=eval(input("enter your name"))
i=0
for x in s:
  if i!=0:
    print("the character present at",i,"index is",x)
  i=i+1
ex2:can you please display krishna for 10 times using for loop
for i in range(10):
  print("krishna")
ex3: print 10 to 1 in descending order
for x in range(10,0,-1) # here -1 means everytime decrement by 1
  print(x)


while loop:
while condition:
  body

ex1:
x=1
while x<=10:
  print(x)
  x+=1 
ex2:
name=""
pwd=""
while name!="krishna" and pwd!="maram":
  name=input("enter name")
  pwd=input("enter pwd")
print("done")

Infinite loops:
i=0
while True:
  i=i+1
  print("Hello:",i)

Nested loops:
for i in range(4):
  for j in range(4):
    print("i={} and j={}.format(i,j))
output: 4*4 =16 lines of code we can see

ex6:
n=int(input("enter the number of rows"))
for i in range(1,n+1): # i represent row number
  for j in range(1,i+1): # j represents the number of  *
    print("*",end=" ")
  print()
ex7:
n = int(input("enter the number of rows"))
for i in range(n):
      print("* "*n)
  or 
n = int(input("enter the number of rows"))
for i in range(n): # row number
  for j in range(n): # number of *
      print("*",end=" ")
  print()

ex8:
n = int(input("enter the number of rows"))
for i in range(1,n+1): # i represents row number
      print("* "*i)
3.Transfer Statements:
----------------------
break
continue
pass

break:
----------
=>Based on some condition if we want to break loop execution then we should go for "break" statement
ex1:
cart=[10,20,600,30,60,40]
for item in cart:
  if item > 500:
    print("sorry for this item, insurance is required")
    break
  print("processing item:",item)



ex2:
i=0
while True:
  print("hello")
  i=i+1
  if i==5:
    break


continue:
---------
=>continue statement is used in while loop to skip current iteration and continue next iteration

ex1:
for i in range(10):
  if i%2==0:
    continue
  print(i)

ex2:
cart=[10,20,600,30,60,40]
for item in cart:
  if item > 500:
    print("sorry for this item, insurance is required")
    continue
  print("processing item:",item)



Loops with else statement:
for-else
while-else
try-except-else-finally 
ex1:
cart=[10,20,600,30,60,40]
for item in cart:
  if item > 500:
    print("sorry for this item, insurance is required")
    break
  print("processing item:",item)
else:
  print("congrats all items processed succesfully")


note: here else means loop without break


1.When do use for loop and while loop?
=>if you know number of iterations in advance then use for loop where as 
=>execute body for every time in the given sequence=>then go for   "for loop"
for x in range(10):
  body
=>execute body as long as some condition is true => then go for "while" loop
while condition:
  body
2.How to exit from the loop?
using "break" statement
3.How to skip current iteration and continue next iteration?
using continue statement
4.when else part will be executed?
if loop executed without break


pass statement:
===============
=>it is an empty/null statement
=>it won't do anything
=>pass is a keyword in python
=>if empty block is required then go for pass statement

ex1:
for i in range(100):
  if i%10==0:
    print(i)
  else:
    pass
