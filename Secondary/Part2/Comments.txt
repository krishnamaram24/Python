Python Comment are statements that are not part of your program. For this reason, comment statements are skipped while executing your program
Usually we use comments for making brief notes about a chunk of code
Comments are most important in programming so that other can understand easily while reading your program

Types of comments in Python
1.Single line comment(used for a brief and quick comment or to debug a program)

to comment single line  used hash symbol(#)

def main():
  # main function


2.Multiple Lines comment(used to note down something much more in details or to block out an entire chunk of code)

to comment multiple lines used triple quotes
def main():
  """
   main function
   this is
  """
