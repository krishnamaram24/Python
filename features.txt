=> Python is a general purpose high level programming language
 general purpose=> means we can use for multiple purposes like we can develop 
 Data Science applications, Machine learning, web applications, IOT applications
 high level=> means human understandable language
 ex: for i in range(10):
    print(i)
=> Python is  Dynamically Typed Programming Language
>>> a= 10
>>> type(a)
>>> a= True
>>> type(a)
(like C, Java Statically Typed programming languages int a = 10)
=> Simple and easy to learn
ex: for i in range(10):
    print(i)
=> Free ware(means we are not pay for licence) and open source(we can able to see source code implementation)
=>Platform independent
write once and run any where(WORA)
=>Portability
Migrating Python program from one platform(windows machine) to another platform(Linux machine) without 
performing any change is nothing but portability
=>Both procedure oriented and object oriented
=> Interpreted programming language(need not require compilation)
Internally python interpretor take care that compilation
if compilation fails then interpretor raised syntax error
if compilation success then only python virtual machine is the responsible to execute 
python interpretor check syntax line by line
=> Extensible programming language
we can use some other languages(C, Java, C#) code in Python to improve performance of the application but there
may be a chance to loose platform indepoendent feature
we have some code in java(1Lack lines of code)
we can improve performance of the application
=> Embedded programming language
python is compatible to work with other languages
we can use python program in other programming languages
=>Extensive Library Support
from random import randint
for i in range(10):
   print(randint(0,9),randint(0,9),randint(0,9),randint(0,9),randint(0,9),randint(0,9),sep='')
