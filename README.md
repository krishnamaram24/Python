How to become a good Programmer
=================================

1.Take help of online platforms

2.Practice

3.Knowledge of using debugging tools

4.Problem solving

5.Required patience

6.Learning and creating new everyday/think to build something new

7.Understand concepts and do nor cram

8.Never stop after Failures!

9.Start developing Passion 

10.Work on basics

11.Start putting question tags(how,what) with every set of code you write
