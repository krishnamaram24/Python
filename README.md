How to become a good Programmer
=======================================
If you are someone who is aspiring to develop a career in Programming and need some guidance on building the relevant skills, then this article will help you a lot


1.Knowledge of using debugging tools

2.Work on basics
As it is true for any industry and any job, the conceptual understanding is the key for success. Unless one has strong conceptual foundation, you can never be a good programmer. The core conceptual understaning helps you in desiging and implementing the best solutions in the best possible way.

3.Start putting question tags(how,what) with every set of code you write


3.write simple, understandable but logical code
As in almost every aspect of life, the formulae of Keep It Simple and Short(KISS) works in programming as well. Write more logical code and avoid complexity. sometimes people do write complex code just to prove their capability to write such codes.

4.spend more time in analyzing the problem, you'll need less time to fix it
Spend more time in understanding and analyzing the problem and designing solutions for it. You will find the rest of the things quite easily doable. Designing not always mean using modeling languages and tools, it can be as simple as looking at sky and thinking solution in your mind. 

5.Read documentation
one of the essential habits of good programmer is that they read lots of documentation. May it be specifications, API documents, tutorials etc. Reading documents helps you creating that essential foundation based on which you program in best of the way

6.You can learn from others code/project as well
Reading and referring reliable and known open source code or your senior's code, can help you making your programming better

7.You learn more by helping others
Most of us having a common tendency of turning our heads towards forums or groups only when we need help. And again a clear separation between the good programmer and rest that the formers visit these places more often to help others. This makes them learn more than they learn getting thier problem solved by someone else. Within a team as well, help others to solve their problems. Believe me, understanding other's problem in their context, investigating on that and providing solutions; will have much more learned than before
