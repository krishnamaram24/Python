Module
-------
=>A Module is collection of classes,functions,variables
=>If you want to use any module, first you have to import that module
=>once you import a  module then you can call any member of that module
syntax:
import module
print(module.member)
here member means=>function,variable
print(module.function())
print(module.variable)

=>you can create alias name by using as key word
=>once you create alias name, by using that we can access functions and variables of that module
import module as alias
print(alias.member)
print(alias.function())
print(alias.variable)

=>You can import a particular member of a module explicitely as follows
=>If you import a member explicitely then it is not required to use module name while accessing 
from module import member
print(function())
print(variable)


=>There are tons of modules rae there in Python
