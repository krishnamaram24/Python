=> Python is a general purpose high level programming language
 general purpose=> means we can use for multiple purposes like we can develop 
 Data Science applications, Machine learning, web applications, IOT applications
 high level=> means human understandable language
 ex: for i in range(10):
    print(i)

=> Python is  Dynamically Typed Programming Language
>>> a= 10
>>> type(a)
>>> a= True
>>> type(a)
(like C, Java Statically Typed programming languages int a = 10)

=> Simple and easy to learn
Python is a simple programming language. When we read python program, we can feel like reading english statements
The syntaxes are very simple and only 30+ keywords are available
ex: for i in range(10):
    print(i)
=> Free ware(means we are not pay for licence) and open source(we can able to see source code implementation and we can customize based on our requirement)

ex:Jython is customized version of Python to work with Java Applications
=>Platform independent
Once you write a python program, it can run on any platform without rewriting once again. Internally PVM is responsible to convert into machine understandable form
write once and run any where(WORA)

=>Portability
Migrating Python program from one platform(windows machine) to another platform(Linux machine) without 
performing any change is nothing but portability

=>Both procedure oriented and object oriented
Python language supports both procedure oriented(like C) and object oriented(like C++) features
 
=> Interpreted programming language(need not require compilation)
Internally python interpretor take care that compilation
if compilation fails then interpretor raised syntax error
if compilation success then only python virtual machine is the responsible to execute 
python interpretor check syntax line by line

=> Extensible programming language
we can use some other languages(C, Java, C#) code in Python to improve performance of the application but there
may be a chance to loose platform indepoendent feature
we can use already existing legacy non-python code
we can improve performance of the application

=> Embedded programming language
python is compatible to work with other languages
we can use python program in other programming languages
we can embedded python programs anywhere

=>Extensive Library Support
Python has a rich inbuilt library
Being a programmer we can use this library directly and we are not responsible to implement the functionality
ex:
from random import randint
for i in range(10):
   print(randint(0,9),randint(0,9),randint(0,9),randint(0,9),randint(0,9),randint(0,9),sep='')
