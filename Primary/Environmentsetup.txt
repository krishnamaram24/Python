When we say Environment Setup,it simply implies a base on top of which we can do our programming. Thus,we need to have the required software setup, 
i.e installation on your PC which will be used to write computer programs, compile, and exeute them

for example, if you need to browse internet, then you need the following setup on your machine
1.A working internet connection to connect to the Internet
2.A web browser such as internet explorer,chrome,firefox

Similarly, you will need the following set up to start with programming using any programming language
1.A Text editor/IDE to create computer programs
2.A compiler to compile the programs into binary format/An interpreter to execute the programs directly
