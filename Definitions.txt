Programming 
=================================
Programming is the act of writing programs, which are a sequence of instructions written using  a programming language to perform a specific task

Program
--------
Program is a sequence of instructions wriiten using a programming language o perform a specific task
program is also called a software, which can range from two lines to millions of lines of instructions
1.Sequence of instructions(Telling address)
2.Programming language(Human language like english)
to understand these terms, consider a situation when someone asks you about how to go to a nearby Hotel

Programmer
------------
Someone who can write programs is called a programmer

Programming language
----------------------
All Human Interface languages have several elements like Grammar, parts of speech 
Like wise all Programming laguages are also made of several elements like
1.Environment Setup
2.Syntax
3.Data types
4.Variables
5.Operators
6.Constants
7.Decition making statements
8.Looping statements


Compiler
----------
program file: You write your computer program using your favorite programming language and save it in a text file called the program file

Program compilation: the conversion from text program to binary file is done by another software called Compiler and this process of conversion from text formatted program
to binary format file is called program compilation. Finally you can execute binary file to perform the programmed task
it takes your source code and converts it to a lower-level language that's either machine code or a bytecode. 
Machine code or bytecode can run much faster than a language being interpreted, beacause the code is simpler and closer to the processor level
Flow:
Computer program file => Compilation => Computer binary file => Program execution

Interpreter
--------------
It reads the source code one line at a time, parses it, executes it, and goes on to the next line 
flow:
Computer program file=>Interpreter=>Program execution


Algorithm
------------
A n algorithm is step-by-step procedure to resolve any problem. An algorithm is an effective method exressed as a finite set of well-defined instructions
Thus a programmer lists down all the steps required to resolve a problem before writing the actual code.



Function
---------- 
A group of statements/lines with some name is called a function


class 
---------

Method
--------

Module
----------------
A group of functions,classes,variables  saved to a file,is called module

Package
-----------
A group of modules is nothing but package

Library
---------------
A group of packages is nothing but library

Framework
-----------------



What is data types vs abstract data types vs data structures?
